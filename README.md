# Mobile Applications I Project 5
# MyAdventure - Snorkeling in the Ocean

## Description
MyAdventure is a simple application that simulates an adventure scenario where the user goes snorkeling in the ocean. This project utilizes concepts learned in Module 5, focusing on implementing a structured design pattern (MVC - Model-View-Controller) and providing interactive choices for the user.

## Adventure Overview
In this adventure, the user embarks on a snorkeling journey in the ocean. They encounter various situations and make choices that determine the outcome of their adventure.

## Adventure Layers
1. **Encounter with a Shark**: The user encounters a shark while snorkeling.
2. **Response to Shark's Attack**: The user responds to the shark's attack.
3. **Running Out of Air**: The user faces the challenge of running out of air underwater.

## Adventure Prompts
1. **Encounter with a Shark**:
   - "You are snorkeling in the ocean... when all of a sudden, you see a shark! What do you do?"
     - Option One: "Swim away quickly!!"
     - Option Two: "Slow down and let him pass."
   
2. **Response to Shark's Attack**:
   - "The shark thought you were food and took a bite! What now??"
     - Option One: "Panic and swim back up to the surface."
     - Option Two: "Stay calm and think."
   
3. **Running Out of Air**:
   - "The shark swam away, but now you are running out of air! What do you do?"
     - Option One: "Swim as fast as I can to the surface!"
     - Option Two: "Turn on the air reserve, duh!"

## Adventure Outcome
- The adventure can end successfully or unsuccessfully based on the user's choices throughout the journey.
- Successful outcomes may include successfully avoiding the shark, remaining calm under pressure, and safely resurfacing.
- Unsuccessful outcomes may involve getting attacked by the shark, drowning underwater, or failing to reach the surface in time.

## Implementation Details
- The application follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern for organized code structure.
- Clone or download the project from the provided GitHub repository.
- Explore the implementation of adventure layers, choices, and outcomes in the codebase.
- Examine how the MVC pattern separates concerns and enhances maintainability.

## Requirements
- The application is designed to run for all size classes, including iPads, and supports landscape orientation.

## Usage
To experience the snorkeling adventure:
1. Open the MyAdventure application on your iOS device or simulator.
2. Navigate through the adventure layers by selecting options presented to you.
3. Make choices wisely as they will affect the outcome of your adventure.
